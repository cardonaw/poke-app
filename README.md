# PokeApp

This project was made for a technical skills test and for practice/study purpose.

The App is made with Angular 18, using PrimeNG for components and PrimeFlex for CSS Classes and LayOut.

Also im using the `responsive-shapes` background component for a better-looking background, made before in order to participate in the Animation-Nation Event of ZTM. You may look at the repo here [responsive-shapes](https://github.com/cardonaw/responsive-shapes).

## Poke-Api

All the information about the pokemons, like types, cries, sprites, etc... Are from the RESTFUL API [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co).

## Features

### - Pokedex

Like the traditional pokemon games, is where you get all the relevant information about the pokemons.

In this case, is not only your pokemons, but all the pokemons available in Poke-Api displayed in a table that can display the pokemons by category too.

### - Game

Its a simple interface where you can choose two pokemons and face them to confront each other and get a winner based just in their type/types (assuming they are the same level and nothing else beside their types matters).
